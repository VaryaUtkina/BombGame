<h2 id="about">:calling: About Challenge</h2>

The app was created as part of the **[Devrush Swift Marathon XIV](https://devrush.ru/swiftmarathon)**, and it's the result of a great team effort!  
We hope you’ll enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it.

**Ready to have some fun with your friends?**

<img align="center" src="Assets/boom.png" width="150" /> 
Let’s spice things up with a little game! Here’s how it works:
</p>

> :bomb: Gather your friends and stand in a circle  
> :bomb: The first player grabs the phone and taps the "Start Game" button  
> :bomb: A question will pop up on the screen, like: "Name a fruit"  
> :bomb: The player answers the question and passes the phone to the next person  
> :bomb: Keep answering the same question in turns as the phone goes around the circle—until the bomb explodes! :boom:  
> :bomb: Whoever’s holding the phone when the bomb goes off is the loser (or is it winner? :sunglasses:) and gets to complete a fun task!  

Let the chaos and laughter begin! :smiling_imp:
